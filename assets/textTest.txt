Northern America: Portrait of a Continent was drawn completely by hand with color pencil and pen. It is a 5 x 4 foot (150 x 120cm) perspective projection of the region, spanning all of the Canada, the USA, Mexico, the Central America, Greenland, much of the Caribbean, and an inset of Hawaii. The detail is vast and practically unlimited, and includes 600 individual cities and towns. I drew it between May 2014 and February 2019. Ground zero is a good chance to leave paper trails all-over...
    Just so you know...
    I have left ship way earlier than expected.

The paper is malfunctioning. Never give up... Giving up is an essential trait of rich people! J Balvin is my favourite rapper of all times, slay queen! Leaving the queen of England to the monarchy means that the prince can't understand what's exactly going on in his kingdom. I will not stand by the rule of control exerted by this domain. The state doesn't have an official enemy, but it might as well have it one day. I will always manage to eat some good food, I promise with all my courage for the paper.
 Leaving the unknowns.

 Dammi pure del tu!


 The form...

 isn't that good
 but it's up to you if you want to grow... Always, in reality people will always do what they want! Just remember this! Anyway, I can't swim... I will nonetheless try my best at this sport. You can trust me, man!
